from attendeeController.js :

exports.index = function(req, res) {
	// this will cause public/javascripts/attendeeClient.js to load
	// which will emit either clientFoundKnownAttendee or clientFoundUnknownAttendee
	// which will be heard by socketConnection.js
	// which renders the attendeeSubView
	// which contains all the info about queues the attendee is in
	res.render('attendeeView', {title: ''});

----
in attendeeInQueueControllerUsingSocket.js look at addAttendeeToQueueUsingSocket 

in there note that the callback used in async is the last function passed to e.g. async.series()
